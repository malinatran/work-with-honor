          text: The question of who should be one of the first ones you answer when
            coming up with your Twitter strategy. You’ve got to determine who is in
            charge of your Twitter account, and who you’re trying to reach. You may
            be a one-person social media shop, and so you’ll be tweeting on behalf
            of, well, yourself; or you might be part of a 12-person team representing
            a major brand. In either case, establish a clear ownership of your Twitter
            account, and identify other team members who might also participate in
            content creation, curation and engagement. If you’re clear about who will
            be managing the Twitter account off the bat, you won’t run into as many
            roadblocks when you go to launch a specific.
